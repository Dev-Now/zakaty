### Exploration sheet
When you start Zakaty App for the first time, you will notice there is already a calculation sheet named **Exploration sheet**.\

**Exploration sheet** will reset upon app restart.

### Zakat Calculation Sheet Operations

You can:
- Configure the selected calculation sheet by editing the title and/or selecting the target currency and zakat due date.
- Delete the selected calculation sheet.
- Copy the selected calculation sheet.
- Create a new empty calculation sheet.
- Save the selected calculation sheet.

### How to Use a sheet to calculate your zakat
Once on your selected sheet, you will be able to see a live summary of your zakat calculations on the header converted to the sheet's target currency. It shows:
- The title of the selected sheet.
- The total of all your savings.
- The computed zakat.
- The amount of zakat you still have to give away (**ToDo** value).

So how do I calculate my zakat using the App?

1. First, configure your calculation sheet by giving it a title, selecting the target currency which is typically the currency you will give your zakat in, and selecting the due date; Basically the date on which a _Hawl_ (Hijri year) has completed since you owned the _Nisab_.\
The due date is important especially when you have savings in other currencies other than your target currency as the conversion rates do vary from day to day; You want to have the conversion rates of the due date.\
Since the due date might be in the future (conversion rates are unknown), the app will keep using the latest rates in this case for the conversions until due date rates are available.
2. Add your **savings** and **Advanced Zakat** amounts by clicking the floating **"+"** button:
- A **Saving** amount typically represents your total savings in a given repository or format at the due date: Bank account total credit, Cash in your pocket, etc.
- An **Advanced Zakat** amount typically represents an amount that you gave away as _Zakat_ before the due date. However, you can also use it to include zakat amounts you gave away after the due date in which case you should turn off the **Include in savings** switch.

3. The app calculates automatically your **ToDo** value as you update your amounts; That's your owed zakat at the due date.

_This app follows standard Zakat rule of 2.5% of the savings total. No Nisab thresholds checking is done._
